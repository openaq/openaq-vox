# openaq-vox, an OpenAQ-powered Alexa skill

This is a simple example app of how to work with OpenAQ for an Alexa skill. You can ask questions like:

- "Alexa, ask Perrin* for help"
- "Alexa, ask Perrin for an overview"
- "Alexa, ask Perrin how many stations are over WHO guidelines"
- "Alexa, ask Perrin for more details"

You can find a video of the skill in action at [![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/848934/21406356/2d1c3948-c799-11e6-88ef-644fc7025fd7.png)](https://vimeo.com/196637570?utm_source=email&utm_medium=vimeo-cliptranscode-201504&utm_campaign=29220)

This is just an example of what's possible, please build on top of it!

### Deployment
Full deployment of an Alexa skill is outside the scope of the readme, but you can find much more info at https://developer.amazon.com/alexa.

The code, utterances and intent schema are all included in this repo. Code can be easily deployed with http://apex.run/.

*There were issues getting Alexa to properly do the commands with 'OpenAQ' so we switched to 'Perrin', since he plays a starring role in the video above.
